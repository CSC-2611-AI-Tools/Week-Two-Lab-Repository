The area under the curve is equal to π/4 since the area of a unit circle is π x r2 = π x 12 = π. 
In this assignment, you will create your own quarter of a unit circle using a character to represent each pixel. 
A space indicates a pixel out of the circle and a * indicates a pixel inside the circle. For example:
